# What is this?

It's a prototype implementation of an embeddable Mongo-compatible database for
use in mobile apps.

This is *not* ready for production use.

For more info, see the blog entry at 
[http://www.ericsink.com/entries/mobile\_sync\_for\_mongo.html](http://www.ericsink.com/entries/mobile_sync_for_mongo.html).

# Is this open source?

Yes.

# What's the license?

Apache License v2

# Why is this written in F#?

Because it's an exploratory prototype, and that was the fastest way to
develop it.

# Will this stay in F# as the only implementation?

If Apple and Google deprecate all their tooling and standardize on Xamarin
for all mobile development, yes.  :-)

Otherwise, this would need to get ported and/or reimplemented in something
else so that people building apps with ObjC or Java could use it.

# Why are you building this?

As part of our exploration of mobile sync solutions for Mongo.

For more info, see the blog entry mentioned near the top of this README.  

# Why is this called Elmo?

It stands for Embeddable Lite Mongo.

# How complete is this?

Most CRUD operations work just like they do in Mongo.

Intentionally omitted:  Sharding, JavaScript

Not done yet:  Full text search, geo, indexes

Number of passing test cases in jstests:  Over 300

For more info, see the blog entry mentioned near the top of this README.  

# How can you be running Mongo's jstests on an "embedded" database?  

Elmo has a server which was written specifically for that purpose.
